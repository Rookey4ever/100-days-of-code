Day 1 : June 29 2018
Today's progress:
Have started off with "Automate Boring stuff with Python".Ttopics covered today : basics, control statements, loops: if, elseif, while.
This covers about 6 lessons in the book. Looking forward to the automation part. I also need to get batter at indentation and at using markdown.
